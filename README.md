# forkline
Forkline is a replay-first tracing and diffing library for agentic AI workflows that lets you deterministically reproduce, fork, and compare agent runs to find exactly where behavior diverged.

## Quick start
Create a virtual environment and install the package in editable mode so examples can import it.

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
python examples/minimal.py
```
